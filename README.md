# ECE-570 Final Project

## How to run the experiments:
#### 1.) Run the "Import Necessary Libraries" section to import the libraries to be used
#### 2.) Run the "Import Influenza data and format" to import and parse Influenza data and the "Import COVID data and format" section to parse for COVID-19 data
#### 3.) Run the "Establish fitting and scoring methods" to compile both models for COVID-19 and for Influenza data so they can fit and project
#### 4.) Run the following three sections in order to fit a model to the Influenza data, the COVID-19 data, and the Combined data (in that order)
#### 5.) Run the final section for each model to make predictions on the COVID-19 Data

## Other notes:
#### All code is original and has been written from scratch (with the exception of the python libraries used)
